"""
The evaluation engine.

This is the decision core: given a domain and an event payload, walk
the enabled policies for that domain in priority order, skip any whose
signature doesn't match its content (tampered), and return the first
one whose conditions all match. If nothing matches — or every
candidate was tampered — fall back to the domain's default action.

This is a pure function of (policies, domain, payload): no I/O, no
database, so it's trivially unit-testable and the same logic that runs
in the Flask route also runs standalone in tests/test_engine.py.
