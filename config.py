"""
Configuration for the Arachnode AI policy engine.

Two secrets matter here, and they are deliberately different:

- SIGNING_SECRET   held by the service itself. Used to HMAC-sign every
                    policy record on write, so the engine can tell a
                    write that went through its own API (signed) from a
                    row mutated directly in the database (unsigned/rogue).
- DISCERNMENT_KEY   held out-of-band by a human approver, never stored
                    next to the data it protects. Required for any
                    action that *loosens* enforcement: setting a policy
                    to ALLOW, or releasing something from quarantine.
                    A compromised process holding SIGNING_SECRET can
                    still forge a signature; it cannot loosen anything
                    without this key.

Both default to dev-only values so the app runs out of the box; set
real values via environment variables before deploying anywhere real.

Storage is plain sqlite3 (standard library) — no ORM dependency to
install, which also means no network access is required to stand this
service up.
